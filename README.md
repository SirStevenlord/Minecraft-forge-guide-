How to install mods for Minecraft without a launcher 

Things you need before we start 

Download Java and install it 
https://www.java.com/

Forge 1.12.2 (make sure to run 1.12.2 before installing)  https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html 
then click on the icon that says installer


Download the files from #necessaryðŸ“– 
Make sure download the 1.12.2 versions of them 

Now go to windows search and type run 
You should see a application with that name if so run it 
Then type this into run search area 

%appdata%\.minecraft

Now that you in the Minecraft folder location on windows, Look for an folder named mods if you see them drop the files you downloaded from #necessaryðŸ“– into it and if you don't see a folder named mods just make a folder named "mod" then do the same step 

After that step head to Minecraft launcher create a new Minecraft Installation(it's under the installations tab on the launcher screen), (click new with the plus sign) select the installation profit named forge 1.12.2 in  the drop down menu 
Then name it whatever you want

Now under the play tab go to the drop down menu and select the installation you created


Also make sure give it half of your system ram for better performance but 2gb-3gb may work just fine 

 Change -xmx1g to however much your system is able give to Minecraft(if I wanted it to have take half of my ram out of 8 then I will change -xmx1g to -xmx4g```
